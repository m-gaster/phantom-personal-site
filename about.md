Hi, I’m Mikhael Gaster — a quantitative social scientist with experience in Python, natural language processing / data science, and consulting. I hold both a Bachelor’s and Master’s degree in Economics and Mathematics from the University of British Columbia.
<br>
<br>
I’m currently a Data Science Research Fellow at <a href="https://activestewardship.org/about-us/"> The Center for Active Stewardship</a> (incubated by <a href="https://jainfamilyinstitute.org/">The Jain Family Institute</a>). I lead our technical development, with duties ranging from full-stack development to partner outreach. Previously, I worked at Oxford University’s Industrial Policy Group, where I developed text classification models. Before that, I worked as a consultant, largely on renewable energy modelling projects on behalf of the government of British Columbia.
<br>
<br>
I’m passionate about using data science to address real-world challenges (if you couldn't tell from my <a href="{{ "/development/2024/10/26/mcpd.html" | relative_url }}">Montgomery County Policing</a> project) and am always open to new collaborations or conversations - feel free to get in touch!
