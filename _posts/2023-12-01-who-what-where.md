In our study, **"The Who, What, When, and How of Industrial Policy,"** we examine global industrial policy (IP) practices from 2009 to 2020. Using natural language processing (NLP), we developed an automated classification algorithm to analyze a large database of policy descriptions. This allowed us to systematically measure and understand IP usage across various countries, industries, and years for the first time.

Our findings indicate that industrial policy is widely used and has become more sophisticated over the past decade. Wealthier liberal democracies are the most active in implementing IP, which is typically targeted and aligned with specific industries' strengths. This research highlights the evolving nature of industrial policy in the global economy and the effective use of machine learning in economic studies.

**My role**: I joined the project as a research assistant, but my responsibilities quickly evolved until I was leading the project's technical side. Under my direction, we improved model accuracy from 87% to 94% by using LLMs in a cloud computing environment. On the less technical side, I collaborated with professors and mentored junior team members.
