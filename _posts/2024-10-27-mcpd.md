This project critically examines the behaviors of the Montgomery County Police Department as they're recorded in public data. By doing so, I aim to provide the public and policymakers with actionable insights that can drive reforms and enhance the transparency of MCPD operations.

<h4>Summary</h4>
<p style="font-size:14px">
Over and under-policing of racial groups is an important part of the police reform debate - most reform advocates argue that racial minorities are discriminated against and over-policed; advocates on the other side respond that policing strategies are often a response to crime rates rather than racial bias. It's essentially impossible to <i>prove</i> (in the econometric sense) over or under-policing from quantitative analyses alone, but as disparities grow between the observable policing outcomes experienced by different racial groups, the burden of proof in this argument shifts away from reformers and toward police and their advocates. As I demonstrate in the following chart, <b>the rate of disparities - especially in negative outcomes for "BLACK" drivers - is so high in Montgomery County that I believe the burden of proof has indeed shifted onto the police to defend their policies</b>.<br><br>

<!-- One additional piece of context should be provided to the reader: in 2021, then MCPD Chief of Police Marcus Jones was presented with this chart (well, not exactly this chart, because it only comprised data up to 2021). He summarily disregarded it, saying (in defence of the MCPD not performing any quantitative analyses of racial disparities in traffic stops)"the study was done using census data and, I and others, believe that the OLO analysis is flawed because you are not looking at the driving population" (<a href="{{ '/assets/Minutes11082021.pdf' | relative_url }}">Source</a>. Note that he had confused my research with <a href="https://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/OLO/Resources/Files/2021_Reports/OLOReport21-10.pdf">this report</a>, which employed the same demographic-to-outcome-ratio analysis.) It seems that Chief Jones was unaware that traffic stop data contains information on each driver's city - determining which drivers are from Montgomery County is not trivial, but it is doable. -->

<br><br> <!-- , and to increase transparency. -->
<hr>
To understand whether racial groups are over or under-policed, we compare each racial group's share of the driver population to their share of an observable outcome received (e.g., "drivers arrested"). For example, if we estimate that "ASIAN" drivers are 5% of the driver population and make up 5% of probable cause searches, it appears that they receive more or less proportionate attention - but if they instead made up <i>50%</i> of probable cause searches, common sense says that they are being over-policed, and the burden of proof shifts to the MCPD to justify this disparity.<br><br>

The core difficulty in performing this analysis is in estimating driver population demographics. A natural starting point is the racial demographics of Montgomery County, which you can ovserve in the first column (<b>MC Pop.</b>). Another way to estimate driver demographics is to examine a subset of traffic citations where officers might have less room for discretion and leniency - for example, citations that are issued to drivers involved in accidents or fatalities, which are displayed in the second and third columns, respectively (<b>Accidents</b> and <b>Fatalities</b>). These two columns have an added analytical "bonus" of taking into account any driving differences between racial groups.<a href="#footnote-1"><sup>1</sup></a>

<br>
<br>
<!-- For each racial group, we then compare the proportion of drivers to the proportion of outcomes. -->
<!-- After deriving estimates for each race's proportion of drivers, we can then compare outcomes to  -->
Now that we have estimates for each race's proportion of drivers, we can compare them to each race's outcomes and get a sense of over/under-policing. The following graph does just that - broadly speaking, the columns are ordered left-to-right from least-discretionary (population estimates) to most discretionary (probable cause searches).

The graph tells the whole story, really. As we measure outcomes that are more at officers' discretions, the big outliers are that "BLACK" drivers receive more policing and "WHITE" drivers receive less:

<ul>
<li>"BLACK" drivers make up 19% of Montgomery County's population and 24% of its accident-related tickets, but 56% of probable cause searches.</li>
<li>"WHITE" drivers make up 41% of Montgomery County's population and 39% of its accident-related tickets, but 21% of probable cause searches.</li>
</ul>



<!-- <p style="font-size:14px">
The first step of this analysis is to estimate how many drivers there are of each race and how they drive (insofar as we're able to discern this); these are represented in the <b>MC Pop.</b> and <b>Accidents</b> columns, respectively.
Then, for each race, we can compare the share of drivers to the share of outcomes.

<br>
<br>
This chart allows us to estimate over and under-policing of each race. Take the most glaring statistic from this chart as an example: "BLACK" drivers represent 19% of Montgomery County's population... but account for <b><i>56%</i></b> of all probable cause searches - nearly 3X their share. It's possible that "BLACK" drivers are, e.g., more reckless - this kind of explanation probably has some merit, considering that "BLACK" drivers received 24% of accident-related tickets(FOOTNOTE) - but I can't think of anything that would explain such a massive disproportion of policing.

In each race’s sub-chart, each column represents that race’s share of that column’s total across all races. For example, the “Stops” column in the
“ASIAN” sub-chart has a value of approximately 7% – this means that 7% of all traffic stops 
were of "ASIAN" drivers.
